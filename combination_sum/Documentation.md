# Combination Sum
## Specification-based testing

### 1. Understand the requirement, inputs, and outputs

Method: `combinationSum(int[] candidates, int target)`

returns a combination of integers where the sum of these integers is equal to the provided `target` parameter

- `candidates`: array with distinct integers
- `target`: integer which the integers of `candidates` have to sum up to

return a list of unique lists, where the integers of each list sum up to `target`

if no combination of the `candidates` integers are possible to sum up to `target`, return `[]`

### 2. Explore the program
We wrote some tests to see how the program behaves

### 3. Explore possible inputs and outputs, and identify partitions
--> negative integers

### 4. Analyze the boundaries


### 5. Devise test cases


### 6. Automate the test cases
see: [CombinationSumTest.java](combination_sum/src/test/java/zest/CombinationSumTest.java)

### 7. Augment the test suite with creativity and experience


## Structural testing


## Mutation testing
